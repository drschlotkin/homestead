Carrots:

Description: Easy to grow, and cold tolerant. Carrots prefer deep, loose or sandy soil and will not grow well if soil is acidic. If you're using manure, make sure it is well aged.

Starting: Direct seed a few weeks before last frost in the spring at 1/4" depth. Space them as close as you want but thin them out when they come up to 4-6 inches apart. Carrot seed germination is slow.

Harvesting and Storing: Carrots will be ready to harvest in 2-3 months. Can be left in the ground late in the fall but should be harvested before ground freezes. Store root vegetables in temperatures just above freezing.

Pests: Rust Fly, Slugs, Earwigs

Pea:

Description: Easy to grow, and cold tolerant. Varieties include: Garden Pea (Edible peas, inedible pod), Snow/Sugar Pea (Edible pod with small peas inside) and Snap Pea (Edible pod with full sized peas). Climbing support for the vines is required.

Starting: Direct seed a month before last frost. Germination can be quicker if seed is soaked overnight. Plant seeds at 1" depth and space them 3-4 inches apart.

Harvesting and storing: Peas can be harvested at any stage but will turn bitter if left on the plant too long. Peas are best fresh and can be frozen for long term.

Pests: Slugs

Onion:

Description: Easy to grow, and very cold tolerant. Onions sets (bulbs) have a higher success rate than seeds.

Starting: Can be planted in early spring, as soon as ground is thawed. Plant bulbs 1-2 inches deep and space them 3-4 inches. Fertilize every two weeks until the fall with a general purpose fertilizer (20-20-20). Onions started from bulbs will typically take 4 months to reach full size.

Harvesting and Storage: When tops are brown and flopped over it is time to harvest. To cure onions, gently brush off dirt and let dry in sunny, ventilated area for 1-2 weeks. Store in a cool room.
