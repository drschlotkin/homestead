Slugs
Description: Slugs will leave a slimy trail both on plants and surrounding soil. They feed on a variety of living plants but prefer tender leaves and seedlings. A sign of slug damage is leaves with holes and ragged edges. They are most active at night and early morning. 

Controls: Deter slugs by keeping vegetation such as grass and weeds cut low around your garden.Fill a small cup with beer and bury it in the soil, replace every few days.Catch slugs by laying down boards around your garden and check underneath during the day to find and dispose of them.Sprinkle a thick layer of diatomaceous earth, egg shells, sand, sawdust or coffee grounds around your plants.Create a barrier using thin strips of sandpaper or copper (tape, wire or tubing).It is also worth noting that ducks, chickens and birds are natural predators for slugs

Description: The preventative measures for this species can also be applied to the cabbage moth. Both lay eggs on the undersides of leaves, to hide from predators. The larvae (caterpillars) will feed on cabbage, brussel sprouts, pok choi, kale, and broccoli.

Description: Also known as the cabbage fly, cabbage root fly or root-maggot fly. They lay their eggs in the early spring near the stems of plants of the cabbage family (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, etc.) The larvae are white maggots that resemble pieces of rice.


Controls: First line of defence would be to cover your vegetables with a row cover, which is a fabric that allows sun and rain to pass through.To prevent the fly from laying its eggs, make a collar from cardboard or carpet with a slit in the middle to fit around your plant.Sticky traps can be effective at catching the root fly, or a yellow dish filled with water and a drop of detergent.As a last resort you can run your fingers through the top layers of soil near the plant and destroy the eggs.


Description: Tiny insects that suck sap from your plant leaves, causing them to curl up and turn yellow. Aphids will rarely kill a mature plant but they carry diseases that can be destructive to your crop. They are often found in clusters on the undersides of leaves.
